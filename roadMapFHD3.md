## Executive Summary
Nearsoft as any other software development company has a defined set of interviews that help us to understand and identify the right candidates. The process has the following steps:
- logic test
- english interview
- screen interview
- profile interview
- pair programming test
- thumbs up meeting

We want to improve the interviews trying to reduce confusion about candidate's information and automatize certain task in the process.

#### The problem

We identified the following issues:
- There is no communication between screening interviews and profile
- There is no a central place where the information can be retrieved by interviewers
- Recruiters have to do a manual summary of the thoughs of interviewers and create the feedback
- Track the interviews made by engineers and the people implied in the process

#### Solution
We would like to:
 - Provide a better place to gather information about a candidate
 - improve the engineer experience of the interview
 - automatize and improve  manual processes to the recruiter

## Goal for the prototype
